# FAERS MCP Server

MCP server for FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data via the OpenFDA API.

**Generated by:** [@sineai/mcp-forge](https://dev.azure.com/sineai/Agents/_git/mcp-forge) v2.0.0

## Features

- Search adverse event reports by drug, reaction, date range
- Get aggregated event counts grouped by reaction, outcome, demographics
- Compare safety profiles across multiple drugs
- Analyze serious events (deaths, hospitalizations, etc.)
- View reporting trends over time
- Find drugs associated with specific reactions
- Identify commonly co-reported drugs

## Authentication

This MCP is configured for **Standalone Mode** - it handles its own authentication.

### Key Vault Secrets

| Secret Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `auth-mode` | `azure_ad`, `api_key`, or `none` |
| `azure-tenant-id` | Azure AD tenant ID |
| `azure-client-id` | App registration client ID |
| `azure-allowed-groups` | Comma-separated group IDs |
| `api-keys` | Comma-separated API keys |
| `openfda-api-key` | (Optional) OpenFDA API key for higher rate limits |

### OpenFDA API Key (Optional but Recommended)

The OpenFDA API works without an API key, but with limits:
- **Without key:** 240 requests/min, 1,000 requests/day per IP
- **With key:** 240 requests/min, 120,000 requests/day per key

**To get a free API key:**
1. Go to https://open.fda.gov/apis/authentication/
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your email for the API key
4. Store in Key Vault as `openfda-api-key` or set `OPENFDA_API_KEY` env var

Core functionality (security, auth, server) comes from the `@sineai/mcp-core` package.

## Quick Start

\`\`\`bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env

# Run locally (stdio mode)
npm run dev

# Run in remote mode (HTTP/SSE)
npm run start:remote
\`\`\`

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_adverse_events` | Search AE reports by drug, reaction, date |
| `get_event_counts` | Aggregated counts by reaction, outcome, demographics |
| `compare_safety_profiles` | Compare AE profiles across 2-5 drugs |
| `get_serious_events` | Filter to serious outcomes only |
| `get_reporting_trends` | AE volume over time by year/quarter/month |
| `search_by_reaction` | Find drugs associated with a reaction |
| `get_concomitant_drugs` | Find commonly co-reported drugs |
| `get_data_info` | Database info and limitations |

## Example Queries

Once connected, you can ask:

- "What are the most common adverse events reported for Humira?"
- "Compare the safety profiles of Humira, Enbrel, and Remicade"
- "Show me serious adverse events for metformin in 2023"
- "What drugs are most commonly associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome?"
- "What's the trend in adverse event reports for Ozempic over the past 3 years?"

## Data Limitations

**IMPORTANT:** FAERS data has significant limitations:

- A report does **NOT** prove the drug caused the event
- Voluntary reporting means many events go unreported
- Cannot calculate incidence rates (no denominator)
- Reporting influenced by publicity and time on market
- Duplicate and incomplete reports exist

This data should be used for signal detection and hypothesis generation, not as the sole basis for clinical decisions.

## Configuration

All config is stored in **Azure Key Vault** - only the Key Vault name is needed in .env!

### .env (Minimal Config)

\`\`\`env
# Only this is required for deployment!
AZURE_KEYVAULT_NAME=your-keyvault

# Optional (for local development)
MCP_MODE=local
PORT=3000
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Optional: OpenFDA API key for higher rate limits
OPENFDA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
\`\`\`

## Deployment

Deploy to Azure Container Apps:

\`\`\`bash
npm run deploy
\`\`\`

This will:
- Build TypeScript
- Build Docker image
- Push to Azure Container Registry
- Create/update Container App
- Grant Key Vault access

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MCP_MODE` | `local` | `local` (stdio) or `remote` (HTTP) |
| `PORT` | `3000` | HTTP port (remote mode) |
| `AZURE_KEYVAULT_URL` | - | Key Vault URL |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `OPENFDA_API_KEY` | - | OpenFDA API key (optional) |

## Cursor Configuration

\`\`\`json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "faers": {
      "url": "https://<your-mcp-url>/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <your-token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
